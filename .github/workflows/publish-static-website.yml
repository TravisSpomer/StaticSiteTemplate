# Requires:
# 1. A repo that contains .github/scripts/publish-static-website.ps1 and generates
#    some static website files into a folder including an index.html
# 2. An Azure Blob Storage account with the "Static website" feature enabled
# 3. A Blob service SAS URL generated from the Portal
#      (with at least read/write access to blobs, and a validity period long enough to copy files)
#
# Setup:
# 1. In Settings > Secrets, add a new secret called PUBLISH_SAS_URL with your SAS URL.
# 2. If you want to enable automatic deployments, uncomment the "push" and "branches" lines below.
# 3. If necessary, configure the PUBLISH_OUTPUT_PATH variable in the "env" section below.
